We pick Brochu's 2D function from the [original paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2007/file/b6a1085a27ab7bff7550f8a3bd017df8-Paper.pdf).

$$
f_{2d}(x_1, x_2) = \max\{0, \sin(x1) + x_1/3 + \sin(12x_1) + \sin(x_2) + x_2/3 + \sin(12x_2) âˆ’ 1 \}
$$
You can use the settings on the sidebar to play around with the bounds of the functions.
A surface plot below should give you a feeling about the function.
